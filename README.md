# VHSME
A program to convert nice clean photos into broken VHS copies... I don't know why either...

The program for now will only display a copy in a quick glut app but I plan on adding bitmap writing.
To use simply pass a .jpg to vhsme.exe as a command line parameter and it will display the "VHS version"

This code is horrible and hasn't been cleaned or optimised... sorry.
